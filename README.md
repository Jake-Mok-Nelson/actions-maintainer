## Installation

### Option 1: Install from source with go install (recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/Jake-Mok-Nelson/actions-maintainer@latest
```

This will install the latest released version to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jake-Mok-Nelson/actions-maintainer
cd actions-maintainer
make build
# Binary will be available at ./bin/actions-maintainer
```

### Option 3: Download pre-built binaries

Download the latest binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/Jake-Mok-Nelson/actions-maintainer/releases).

## Usage

### Basic Scanning

Scan all repositories for a GitHub user or organization:

```bash
./actions-maintainer scan --owner github --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### Save Results to File

```bash
./actions-maintainer scan --owner my-org --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --output results.json
```

### Create Pull Requests for Updates

Create automated pull requests for all detected action updates and migrations:

```bash
./actions-maintainer scan --owner my-org --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --create-prs
```

This will:
- Create separate PRs for each repository with action updates
- Handle both version updates and repository migrations in the same PR
- Include detailed descriptions with migration reasoning
- Apply any necessary parameter transformations during migrations

### Using Environment Variable for Token

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
./actions-maintainer scan --owner my-org
```

## Authentication

You need a GitHub personal access token with the following permissions:
- `repo` (for accessing private repositories)
- `public_repo` (for accessing public repositories)

Set the token using:
- `--token` flag
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable

### Organization vs User Repository Access

The tool automatically detects whether the target is a GitHub user or organization and uses the appropriate API endpoints:

- **Organizations**: Uses `/orgs/{org}/repos` endpoint with `type=all` to include private repositories
- **Users**: Uses `/users/{user}/repos` endpoint with `type=all` to include private repositories
- **Fallback behavior**: If organization endpoint fails due to permissions, automatically falls back to user endpoint

For **private organizations**, ensure your token has:
- Organization membership or appropriate repository access permissions
- If you only have access to specific repositories within an organization, the tool will gracefully fall back to the user endpoint which may show fewer repositories

Use `--verbose` flag to see which endpoints are being used and troubleshoot access issues.

## Custom Rules and Advanced Configuration

### Creating Custom Rules Files

actions-maintainer supports custom rules files to define organization-specific action policies:

```json
{
  "version_rules": [
    {
      "repository": "my-org/custom-action",
      "latest_version": "v2.0.0",
      "minimum_version": "v1.5.0", 
      "deprecated_versions": ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0"],
      "recommendation": "Upgrade for enhanced security features"
    }
  ],
  "migration_rules": [
    {
      "from_repository": "old-org/action",
      "to_repository": "new-org/action", 
      "to_version": "v3.0.0",
      "recommendation": "Action moved to new maintainer"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rule Types Supported

1. **Version Rules**: Define latest, minimum, and deprecated versions
2. **Migration Rules**: Handle repository location changes  
3. **Workflow Migration Rules**: Migrate reusable workflows between repos
4. **Parameter Transformation Rules**: Automatic parameter changes during upgrades

### Advanced Filtering and Targeting

```bash
# Filter by repository name patterns
./bin/actions-maintainer scan --owner myorg --filter "frontend-.*"

# Target specific workflow types only
./bin/actions-maintainer scan --owner myorg --workflow-only

# Combine custom rules with filtering
./bin/actions-maintainer scan --owner myorg --filter "legacy-.*" --rules-file migration-rules.json
```

See the `examples/` directory for complete templates and usage patterns.

## Output Format

The tool outputs detailed JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "owner": "github",
  "scan_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "repositories": [
    {
      "name": "repo-name",
      "full_name": "github/repo-name",
      "workflow_files": [...],
      "actions": [...],
      "issues": [...]
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_repositories": 50,
    "total_workflow_files": 125,
    "total_actions": 300,
    "unique_actions": {...},
    "issues_by_type": {...},
    "top_issues": [...]
  }
}
```

## Supported Issue Types

- **Outdated**: Action versions that are behind the latest release
- **Deprecated**: Action versions that are no longer supported
- **Migration**: Actions that have moved to new repository locations
- **Security**: Action versions with known security vulnerabilities

## Version Alias Resolution

actions-maintainer supports intelligent version alias resolution to handle scenarios where different version references point to the same underlying commit:

### Example Scenarios
- `v1` tag and `v1.2.4` tag point to the same commit SHA
- `v4` tag and commit SHA `abc123def456` reference the same commit
- When `v1` is updated to point to a new release, aliases are automatically detected

### Resolution Modes

**Default (with resolution):**
```bash
actions-maintainer scan --owner myorg --token $GITHUB_TOKEN
```
Uses GitHub API to resolve version references to commit SHAs for accurate comparison.

**String matching only:**
```bash
actions-maintainer scan --owner myorg --token $GITHUB_TOKEN --skip-resolution
```
Uses traditional string-based version comparison for faster execution or when API access is limited.

### Benefits
- **Accuracy**: Detects equivalent versions even with different reference formats
- **Flexibility**: Supports tags, commit SHAs, and branch references
- **Performance**: 1-hour caching reduces GitHub API calls
- **Resilience**: Graceful fallback to string matching on API failures

- Parameter transformations during version upgrades
- Repository location migration support  
- Workflow content patching with change tracking
- Rule-based transformation logic for common actions

## Examples and Templates

The `examples/` directory contains comprehensive templates and examples for common scenarios:

### üìÅ [Examples Directory Structure](examples/)

- **`examples/rules/`** - Ready-to-use rule files for different scenarios
  - `basic-updates.json` - Update popular actions to latest versions
  - `organization-migration.json` - Handle org changes and action moves
  - `workflow-migration.json` - Migrate reusable workflows between repos
  - `custom-transformations.json` - Parameter transformations during upgrades

- **`examples/workflows/`** - Before/after workflow examples
  - Shows actual transformations applied by the tool
  - Demonstrates parameter changes, version updates, and migrations

- **`examples/commands/`** - CLI command examples and scripts
  - Common usage patterns and batch operations
  - Step-by-step migration processes

### üöÄ Quick Start Examples

**Basic Action Updates:**
```bash
./bin/actions-maintainer scan --owner myorg --rules-file examples/rules/basic-updates.json --create-prs
```

**Organization Migration:**
```bash
./bin/actions-maintainer scan --owner myorg --rules-file examples/rules/organization-migration.json --create-prs --verbose
```

**Workflow Consolidation:**
```bash
./bin/actions-maintainer scan --owner company --workflow-only --rules-file examples/rules/workflow-migration.json --create-prs
```

### Example Workflow Analysis

Given a workflow file with:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
```

The tool will identify:
- `actions/checkout@v3` ‚Üí should be updated to `v4`
- `actions/setup-node@v2` ‚Üí should be updated to `v4` (high severity)
- `actions/cache@v3` ‚Üí should be updated to `v4`

And with example rules, it will transform to:
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1
          fetch-tags: false
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'  # Parameter renamed
          cache: 'npm'        # Built-in caching
      # Cache action removed - built into setup-node v4
```

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_repositories": 1,
    "total_actions": 3,
    "issues_by_type": {
      "outdated": 3
    },
    "issues_by_severity": {
      "high": 1,
      "low": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Built-in Action Rules

The tool includes rules for popular GitHub Actions:

- `actions/checkout` (latest: v4)
- `actions/setup-node` (latest: v4)
- `actions/setup-python` (latest: v5)
- `actions/upload-artifact` (latest: v4)
- `actions/download-artifact` (latest: v4)
- `actions/cache` (latest: v4)
- `actions/setup-go` (latest: v5)
- `actions/setup-java` (latest: v4)

## Action Location Migration

The patcher system now supports migration of actions to new repository locations, allowing for seamless transitions when actions move or are reorganized. This feature supports:

### Migration Types

1. **Organization Migration**: Actions moving between organizations
   ```yaml
   # Before
   - uses: old-org/standard-action@v3
   
   # After
   - uses: new-org/standard-action@v3
   ```

2. **Repository Migration**: Actions moving to completely new repository names
   ```yaml
   # Before
   - uses: legacy-org/deprecated-action@v1
     with:
       old-param: value
   
   # After  
   - uses: modern-org/recommended-action@v2
     with:
       new-param: value
       migrate-notice: "This action has been migrated..."
   ```

### Automatic Parameter Transformation

During location migration, the patcher can also transform action parameters:

- **Parameter Renaming**: `old-param` ‚Üí `new-param`
- **Parameter Addition**: Adding new required/recommended parameters
- **Parameter Removal**: Removing deprecated parameters
- **Value Modification**: Updating parameter values for compatibility

### Configuration

Location migration rules are defined in the patcher's rule system with both source and target repositories:

```go
{
    FromVersion:    "v1",
    ToVersion:      "v2", 
    FromRepository: "legacy-org/deprecated-action",
    ToRepository:   "modern-org/recommended-action",
    Description:    "Migration to new maintainer with enhanced features",
    Patches: []FieldPatch{
        // Parameter transformations...
    },
}
```

This enables the tool to handle complex migration scenarios where actions not only change versions but also move to new locations with different parameter schemas.

## Automated Migration Pull Requests

When repository migrations are detected, the PR creation system automatically handles the complete migration process:

### Migration Detection to PR Creation

1. **Detection**: The action analysis system identifies when actions have migrated to new repositories
2. **Planning**: Migration targets are parsed and validated from the detection results
3. **Workflow Updates**: YAML workflow files are updated to use the new repository locations
4. **PR Creation**: Dedicated pull requests are created with detailed migration information

### PR Content for Migrations

Pull requests that include migrations feature a dedicated "üöÄ Action Migrations" section:

```markdown
### üöÄ Action Migrations

- **legacy-org/deprecated-action**: `legacy-org/deprecated-action@v1` ‚Üí `modern-org/recommended-action@v2`
  - **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - **Reason**: Action has migrated to modern-org/recommended-action for better maintenance

### üìä Version Updates

- **actions/checkout**: v3 ‚Üí v4
  - **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
```

### Example Migration Workflow

Before migration:
```yaml
- uses: legacy-org/deprecated-action@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
```

After migration:
```yaml
- uses: modern-org/recommended-action@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
```

The system ensures that both repository changes and version updates are applied correctly, with parameter transformations when needed.
